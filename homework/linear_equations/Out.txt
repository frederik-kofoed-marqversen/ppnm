Generated random 5 by 3 matrix A
Perfomed QR factorisation on A
R is upper triangular?: true
Q^TQ = I: true
QR = A: true

Generated new random 5 by 5 matrix A and 5-vector b
Perfomed QR factorisation on A
Solved Rx = Q^Tb for x by back-substitution
QRx = b: true

Computed matrix inverse of A from above
A^(-1)A = I: true
