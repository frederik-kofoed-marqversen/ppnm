Code and notes from the course "Practical Programming and Numerical Methods"

Why have I not used Cargo?
  One of the prescribed learning outcomes of the course was to be able to use the GNU make utility for management and execution of a project.

Learning outcomes of the course (contents of this repo):
  Use of the Rust programming language and the GSL scientific library to solve the typical physics-related problems;
  Project and library management using the GNU make utility;
  Data visualisation with the Gnuplot system;
  Theoretical understanding of the foundations of basic numerical methods;
  Identification and application of necessary numerical methods in a given physical problem;
  Estimation of the numerical accuracy of result;

Current progress:
