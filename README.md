# PPNM
Code and notes from the course "Practical Programming and Numerical Methods" (PPNM) in the spring of 2023

## Libraries
The libraries folder contains all of the dependencies used in exercises and homework. All libraries, except for the ones listed below, are original and were written during the course.
* `num_complex` + `num_traits`: From the official [`num`](https://crates.io/crates/num) crate.
* `scientific::rand`: Minimal implementation of core features from the offical [`fastrand`](https://crates.io/crates/fastrand) crate.

## Why have I not used Cargo?
One of the prescribed learning outcomes of the course was to learn how to use the GNU make utility for management and execution of a project. Using Cargo would have made this a trivial exercise witout much exposure to make.

## Learning outcomes of the course (contents of this repo):
* Using the Rust programming language and GSL scientific library to solve typical physics-related problems;
* Project and library management using the GNU make utility;
* Data visualisation with the Gnuplot system;
* Theoretical understanding of the foundations of basic numerical methods;
* Identification and application of necessary numerical methods in a given physical problem;
* Estimation of the numerical accuracy of result;
